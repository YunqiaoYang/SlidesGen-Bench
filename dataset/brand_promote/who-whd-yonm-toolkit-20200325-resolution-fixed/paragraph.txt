Generate a compelling PowerPoint presentation for the World Health Day 2020 #SupportNursesAndMidwives campaign focused on brand promotion of healthcare workforce appreciation during the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. The presentation should include: campaign objectives highlighting nurses' critical role in COVID-19 response, target audience segmentation (general public, policy-makers, health workers), key messaging around supporting and investing in nursing/midwifery workforce, visual assets from the advocacy toolkit, call-to-action strategies for thanking healthcare workers and lobbying leaders, and real-world testimonials from healthcare professionals. Maintain WHO's professional yet compassionate brand tone throughout the presentation while emphasizing the urgent need for healthcare workforce investment and recognition.
