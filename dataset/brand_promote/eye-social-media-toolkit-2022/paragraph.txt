Generate a compelling PowerPoint presentation for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy campaign focused on brand promotion. The presentation should include: the three strategic objectives (protect at-risk populations, prevent international spread, and contain outbreaks rapidly), key partnership messaging with WHO, Gavi, UNICEF and 50+ partners, social media toolkit elements including graphics and hashtags (#EYE2022 #wearepartners), and educational content about yellow fever prevention and vaccination. Maintain the campaign's authoritative yet accessible health communication tone throughout the presentation, designed to raise awareness and promote partnership engagement with global health organizations and stakeholders.
