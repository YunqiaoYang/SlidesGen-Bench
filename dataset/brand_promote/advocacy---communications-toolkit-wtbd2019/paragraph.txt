Generate a compelling PowerPoint presentation for the World TB Day 2019 'It's Time!' campaign focused on global health advocacy and brand promotion. The presentation should include: the campaign's urgency messaging around ending tuberculosis, key statistics on TB's global impact, target audience engagement strategies for healthcare professionals and policy makers, visual identity guidelines featuring the WHO's blue and white design elements with diverse population imagery, and clear call-to-action strategies including policy advocacy, funding requests, and research investments. Maintain the WHO's authoritative yet accessible tone throughout the presentation, designed to mobilize stakeholders and accelerate action to end TB suffering and deaths worldwide.
