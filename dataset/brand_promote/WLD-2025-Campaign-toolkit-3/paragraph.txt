Generate a compelling PowerPoint presentation for the World Liver Day 2025 Campaign Toolkit focused on mobilizing global advocacy and promoting the #FoodIsMedicine initiative. The presentation should include: the campaign's core mission to advocate for liver health on 19 April 2025, the central theme highlighting nutrition's critical impact on liver function and metabolic health, key messages emphasizing that healthy lifestyle changes can cut liver disease risk by 50% and potentially reverse damage, actionable social media strategies including the "Cook, Snap, Share" challenge and usage of specific hashtags like #WorldLiverDay, educational resources such as the liver-friendly recipe book and dietitian tips available on worldliverday.org, and the strategic "Plan, Share, Act" implementation framework for partners. Maintain an empowering and informative tone that underscores the vital connection between diet and liver health, while encouraging widespread community participation and policy awareness to support the Healthy Livers, Healthy Lives Coalition's global goals.
