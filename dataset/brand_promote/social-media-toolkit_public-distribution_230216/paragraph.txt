Generate a compelling PowerPoint presentation for the WHO Global Report on Health Equity for Persons with Disabilities campaign focused on brand promotion. The presentation should include: key health equity statistics (1.3 billion people with disabilities facing healthcare barriers), 40 disability-inclusive actions for health sector implementation, personal testimonials highlighting discrimination in healthcare, accessibility guidelines for inclusive communication, and strategic hashtags (#ActionForEquity #HealthForAll) for social media engagement. Maintain the WHO's authoritative yet compassionate tone throughout the presentation, designed to raise awareness about health inequities and drive action on International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
