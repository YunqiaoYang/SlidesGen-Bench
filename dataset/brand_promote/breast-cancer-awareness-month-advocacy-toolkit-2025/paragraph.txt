Generate a compelling PowerPoint presentation for the WHO Global Breast Cancer Initiative's Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2025 campaign focused on brand promotion and health advocacy. The presentation should include: the campaign theme 'Every Story is Unique, Every Journey Matters', WHO's GBCI 60-60-80 strategic targets, social media engagement strategies using #EveryStoryIsUnique, campaign assets and toolkit resources, and actionable steps for community involvement and advocacy. Maintain the WHO's authoritative yet compassionate tone throughout the presentation, designed to empower healthcare organizations, advocates, and community leaders to implement effective breast cancer awareness initiatives and drive meaningful engagement with diverse global audiences.
