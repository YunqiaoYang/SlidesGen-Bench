Generate a PowerPoint presentation introducing recursion in Python programming. The main parts are as follows: recursion basics covering the fundamental concept and how it builds solutions from smaller problems, followed by simple math recursion demonstrating factorial calculations with base and recursive cases, recursion with strings and lists exploring palindrome detection and list permutation checking, more advanced math recursion including Fibonacci sequences and greatest common divisor algorithms, and finally using recursion to solve complex problems like binary search and the Three Towers puzzle, which explores how recursive thinking simplifies difficult programming challenges.
