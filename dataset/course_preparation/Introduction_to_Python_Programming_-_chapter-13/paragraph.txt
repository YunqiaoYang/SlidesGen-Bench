Generate a PowerPoint presentation introducing inheritance in Python programming. The main parts are as follows: inheritance basics covering is-a vs has-a relationships and subclass/superclass concepts, attribute access showing how subclasses inherit and create instance attributes, methods including overriding and using super() for accessing superclass methods, followed by hierarchical inheritance exploring multiple classes inheriting from a single superclass, and multiple inheritance with mixin classes to address the diamond problem and promote modularity.
