Generate a PowerPoint presentation introducing confidence intervals for statistical inference. The main parts are as follows: introduction to point estimates vs. interval estimates and their role in inferential statistics, confidence intervals when the population standard deviation is known or large sample size using the normal distribution, confidence intervals when the population standard deviation is unknown and small sample case using the Student's t-distribution, confidence intervals for population proportions using binomial distributions, and calculating appropriate sample sizes for both continuous and binary random variables. The presentation explores the relationship between confidence levels and interval width, the Central Limit Theorem's role in constructing intervals, and practical applications in business and research contexts.
