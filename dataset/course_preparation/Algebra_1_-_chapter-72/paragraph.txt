Generate a PowerPoint presentation introducing analyzing exponential graphs. The main parts are as follows: patterns in real numbers through fraction and decimal relationships, comparing exponential decay graphs using cell phone depreciation examples, describing graphs by matching exponential scenarios with their visual representations, and analyzing quantities that change exponentially in real-world contexts. This explores how to read exponential growth and decay from graphs, write equations from graphical information, and connect mathematical representations to practical situations like technology depreciation, population growth, and medical applications.
