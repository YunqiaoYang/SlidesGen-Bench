Generate a PowerPoint presentation introducing linear equations and algebraic modeling. The main parts are as follows: solving linear equations using a general strategy (including distributive property, combining like terms, and isolating variables), classifying equations as conditional, identity, or contradiction based on their solutions, and identifying coordinates of points on a rectangular coordinate system. The presentation should explore how variables, expressions, and equations model real-world relationships and constraints, connecting algebraic concepts to graphical representations and practical applications like budget management.
