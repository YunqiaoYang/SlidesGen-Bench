Generate a PowerPoint presentation introducing writing and solving inequalities in one variable. The main parts are as follows: writing inequalities to represent constraints in real-world situations, using inequalities to solve problems with unknown quantities, exploring different strategies for solving inequalities including testing values and reasoning about inequality structure, matching inequalities with their graphical solutions, and applying addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division properties of inequalities while understanding when to reverse inequality symbols when multiplying or dividing by negative numbers.
