I am the OECD Secretary-General, please generate a comprehensive tax policy report for G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors about international tax cooperation, BEPS implementation, and the Two-Pillar Solution. The presentation should include: progress on the Two-Pillar International Tax Package (Pillar One and Pillar Two), BEPS minimum standards implementation, tax transparency achievements through the Global Forum, tax certainty initiatives, digital transformation in tax administration, and capacity building support for developing countries. The report should effectively communicate our accomplishments in combating tax evasion, supporting domestic resource mobilization, and advancing global tax cooperation while maintaining a professional tone appropriate for high-level financial leadership.
