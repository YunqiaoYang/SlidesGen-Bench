I am the OECD Centre on Well-being, Inclusion, Sustainability and Equal Opportunity (WISE), please generate a comprehensive policy report for policymakers, government stakeholders, and international organizations about global experiences of discrimination. The presentation should include: key findings that almost 25% of people worldwide report experiencing discrimination, regional variations showing higher rates in Northern America and Oceania, analysis of how women, young people and low-income earners face the highest discrimination rates, qualitative evidence from OECD countries highlighting intersectional discrimination experiences, and policy recommendations for improving data collection on at-risk groups. The report should effectively communicate our research findings on discrimination patterns across different regions and demographic groups, while maintaining a professional tone appropriate for policy audiences and emphasizing the urgent need for better anti-discrimination measures and data collection standards.
