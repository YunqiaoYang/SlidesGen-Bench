I am the OECD Secretary-General, please generate a comprehensive tax report for G20 Leaders about international tax developments and reforms. The presentation should include: key achievements in implementing the Two-Pillar International Tax Package including the global minimum tax and Subject-To-Tax Rule, progress on BEPS minimum standards implementation, developments in tax transparency and exchange of information, work on tax and inequality addressing high-net-worth individuals, and capacity building support for developing countries. This report is designed to inform world leaders on the transformational progress made in international tax cooperation and demonstrate the OECD's commitment to creating a fairer global tax system. Maintain a professional and authoritative tone that is appropriate for G20 Leaders while highlighting concrete achievements and future commitments.
