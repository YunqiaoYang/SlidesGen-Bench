I am the OECD, please generate a technical report for policymakers, trade experts, and international stakeholders about the methodology for the OECD Index of Digital Trade Integration and Openness (INDIGO). The presentation should include: the comprehensive framework covering five policy areas (enabling e-commerce, openness, trust, cross-border data flows, and wider digital economy issues), the scoring methodology distinguishing between trade and non-trade instruments, the bilateral aggregation approach across 28 specific areas, and the weighting structures used to measure digital trade integration. This report aims to provide transparency on our innovative methodology for tracking international digital trade cooperation and demonstrate how the INDIGO captures both the depth and breadth of digital trade commitments globally. Maintain a professional and technical tone appropriate for policy and academic audiences.
