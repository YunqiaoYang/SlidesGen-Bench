I am the OECD WISE Centre, please generate a comprehensive policy report for policymakers, educators, parents, and digital stakeholders about childhood in the digital age. The presentation should include: key findings on children's digital device usage patterns across OECD countries, risks and benefits of digital engagement including problematic social media use and cyberbullying, policy recommendations for regulatory frameworks and safety-by-design measures, guidance for supporting digital literacy and healthy digital practices, and evidence-based approaches to enhance child well-being in digital environments. The report should effectively communicate our research findings and policy insights while maintaining a professional and evidence-based tone appropriate for government officials and child welfare stakeholders.
