I am the OECD, please generate a comprehensive policy brief report for development assistance policymakers and DAC member countries about the projected 9-17% cuts in official development assistance for 2025 and their near-term implications. The presentation should include: detailed projections and analysis of ODA cuts by major providers (France, Germany, UK, US), impact assessments on least developed countries and sub-Saharan Africa, effects on vital sectors like health and education, multilateral organization funding challenges, and coordinated action recommendations for mitigating risks to the poorest countries and populations most in need. Maintain an authoritative and analytical tone appropriate for international development policy stakeholders.
