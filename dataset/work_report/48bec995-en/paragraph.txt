I am the OECD, please generate a policy brief for G20 policymakers about financing instruments and policy levers to harness biomanufacturing for climate, biodiversity and growth. The presentation should include: key messages about biomanufacturing's potential for supply chain resilience and economic growth, critical investment gaps in bioeconomy innovation, various financing mechanisms such as blended finance and risk transfer instruments, selected examples of G20 countries' biomanufacturing investment strategies, and actionable policy recommendations for mobilizing private investment. The brief should maintain a professional and analytical tone appropriate for international policymakers and effectively communicate our research findings on sustainable biomanufacturing financing frameworks.
