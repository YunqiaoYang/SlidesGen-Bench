I am the OECD Secretary-General, please generate a comprehensive tax policy report for G20 Leaders about international tax co-operation developments and BEPS implementation progress. The presentation should include: progress on the global minimum tax implementation with over 65 jurisdictions committed, continued BEPS journey achievements across all four minimum standards, new Inclusive Framework work items on tax policy and inequality, significant developments in tax transparency with 172 Global Forum member jurisdictions, and extensive tax and development work supporting developing countries. The report should effectively communicate the substantial progress made in international tax reform, address ongoing challenges including US concerns about duplicative tax systems, and demonstrate the OECD's leadership in facilitating global tax co-operation. Maintain a professional and authoritative tone appropriate for world leaders while highlighting concrete achievements and future priorities in international taxation.
