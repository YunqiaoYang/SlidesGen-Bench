I am the OECD Centre on Well-being, Inclusion, Sustainability and Equal Opportunity (WISE), please generate a policy insights report for policymakers and stakeholders about inequality of opportunity and creating a more level playing field in OECD countries. The presentation should include: key findings on how inherited circumstances explain over 25% of income inequality, the role of parental background and geographic disparities in shaping opportunities, evidence on place-based barriers to education and employment, and comprehensive policy recommendations for promoting equal opportunity through human capital enhancement, wealth distribution measures, and social infrastructure expansion. This report is designed to inform public debates and guide effective policy design for creating fairer economic outcomes across OECD member countries.
