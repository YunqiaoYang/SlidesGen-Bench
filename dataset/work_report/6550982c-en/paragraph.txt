I am the OECD Centre on Well-being, Inclusion, Sustainability and Equal Opportunity (WISE), please generate a comprehensive policy report for policymakers, government officials, and family policy stakeholders about the cost of raising children across evolving family structures in European OECD countries. The presentation should include key findings on expenditure-based and financial strain-based child costs, the disproportionate burden on single-parent households, the hidden costs of non-resident children in shared custody arrangements, and policy recommendations for supporting diverse family types. The report should effectively communicate our research insights on how modern family living arrangements impact household finances and inform policies to provide children with adequate standards of living while promoting child well-being and fertility. Maintain a professional and evidence-based tone appropriate for policy audiences.
