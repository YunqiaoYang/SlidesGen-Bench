I am the OECD WISE Centre, please generate a comprehensive policy report for leadership teams and policymakers about SDG data gaps and monitoring challenges in OECD countries. The presentation should include: key findings on data timeliness issues affecting over 40% of SDG indicators, measurement gaps across critical areas like climate action and gender equality, challenges with data granularity and disaggregation, sectoral gaps in environmental sustainability indicators, and emerging data innovations including AI and machine learning approaches. The report should effectively communicate our research insights on strengthening SDG implementation and highlight actionable recommendations for improving data systems and monitoring frameworks. Maintain a professional and analytical tone appropriate for policy audiences and international organizations.
