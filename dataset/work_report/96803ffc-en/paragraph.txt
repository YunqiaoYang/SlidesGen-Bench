I am the OECD, please generate a policy brief report for policymakers and development cooperation partners about development cooperation and the elimination of plastic pollution. The presentation should include: our analysis of global plastic pollution challenges, investment needs for waste management systems, the growth and allocation of official development assistance (ODA) for plastic pollution reduction, the catalytic role of development cooperation in mobilizing finance, and policy recommendations for scaling up action to end plastic pollution. The report should effectively communicate our research findings on plastic waste mismanagement projections, regional disparities in funding needs, and the critical importance of international cooperation in addressing this global environmental challenge.
