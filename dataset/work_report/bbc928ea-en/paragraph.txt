I am the OECD, please generate a comprehensive policy brief for European Commission officials, national policymakers, and child welfare stakeholders about implementing the European Child Guarantee in Portugal. The presentation should include: key recommendations for reinforcing national governance frameworks, strengthening community-based management through Local Child Guarantee Units, developing robust monitoring and evaluation systems, improving data collection on children in need at local levels, and enhancing meaningful child and youth participation in policy implementation. The brief should effectively communicate our assessment findings, technical assistance outcomes, and strategic recommendations to support Portugal's efforts in combating child poverty and social exclusion while maintaining a professional and evidence-based tone appropriate for high-level policy audiences.
