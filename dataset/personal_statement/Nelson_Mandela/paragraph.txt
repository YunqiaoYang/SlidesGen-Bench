I am Nelson Mandela, please generate a personal work report/promotion PPT presentation for my presidential performance review covering 1994-1999. The presentation should include: leading South Africa's first multiracial democratic election with 63% ANC victory, establishing the unprecedented Government of National Unity with former adversaries, spearheading national reconciliation through symbolic gestures like the 1995 Rugby World Cup moment, creating the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that became a global model for post-conflict resolution, and transforming South Africa from an international pariah state to a respected democracy while maintaining economic stability and preventing civil war, designed to showcase my transformational leadership and reconciliation capabilities to the Citizens of South Africa and International Community.
