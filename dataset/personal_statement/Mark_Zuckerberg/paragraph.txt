I am Mark Zuckerberg, please generate a personal work report/promotion PPT presentation for my annual performance review. The presentation should include: my successful orchestration of end-to-end encrypted systems integration across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp leading to increased cross-platform engagement, my personal leadership in international expansion including diplomatic meetings with world leaders like Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, my vision of 'moving fast and breaking things' that became industry standard through institutionalizing hackathons, my crisis leadership during the Cambridge Analytica scandal with Congressional testimony, and my strategic positioning of Meta for future growth with a $220 billion net worth achievement. This presentation is designed to showcase my exceptional executive leadership and value creation capabilities to the Board of Directors and shareholders for continued CEO leadership recognition.
