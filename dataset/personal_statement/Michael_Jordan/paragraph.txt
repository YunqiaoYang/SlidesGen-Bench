I am Michael Jordan, please generate a personal work report/promotion PPT presentation for my transition from player to executive leadership roles. The presentation should include: my unprecedented performance at age 40 (averaging 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists while becoming the first 40-year-old to score 43 points in an NBA game), franchise value enhancement (transforming the Wizards into the second most-watched NBA team with sold-out home games), dual role leadership as both active player and basketball operations executive, and my strategic vision for future ownership opportunities including the Charlotte franchise and Jordan Brand expansion, designed to showcase my unique qualifications for sports business leadership to support my transition into NBA franchise ownership.
