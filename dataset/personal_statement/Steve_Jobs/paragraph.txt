I am Steve Jobs, please generate a personal work report/promotion PPT presentation for my 2011 annual performance review and legacy documentation. The presentation should include: my successful CEO transition to Tim Cook while maintaining strategic oversight, transforming Apple from near-bankruptcy in 1997 to the world's most valuable company by market capitalization in 2011 (exceeding 30% compound annual growth rate over 14 years), revolutionary product development including the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad that created entirely new market categories, strategic leadership in building Apple's premium brand position and retail ecosystem, and my vision for Apple's continued innovation at the intersection of technology and liberal arts, designed to showcase my transformational leadership capabilities and innovation legacy to the Board of Directors and shareholders.
