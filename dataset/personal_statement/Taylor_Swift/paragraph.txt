I am Taylor Swift, please generate a personal work report/promotion PPT presentation for my annual performance review. The presentation should include: my achievement of billionaire status as the first artist primarily based on songs and performances, the record-breaking $2 billion Eras Tour revenue and $250 million concert film success, strategic catalog reclamation through master purchase and re-recording strategy, market dominance with The Tortured Poets Department becoming the fastest album to reach one billion Spotify streams, and my position as the highest-grossing touring act of all time with $3.12 billion cumulative revenue, designed to showcase my leadership in transforming artistic work into a billion-dollar entertainment empire to the Board of Directors and Shareholders.
