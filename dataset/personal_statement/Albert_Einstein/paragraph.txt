I am Albert Einstein, please generate a personal work report/promotion PPT presentation for my career advancement review covering my period as Director of the Institute for Advanced Study from 1945-1955. The presentation should highlight my revolutionary scientific achievements including the completion of general theory of relativity and experimental validation through gravitational lensing, my 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for the photoelectric effect, and my strategic leadership during the crisis period when I successfully transitioned from Berlin to Princeton and established the Institute as a premier international refuge for displaced scientists including John von Neumann, Kurt Gödel, and Hermann Weyl, designed to demonstrate my scientific excellence and institutional leadership capabilities to the Board of Directors and stakeholders.
