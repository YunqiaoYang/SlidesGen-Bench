I am Barack Obama, please generate a personal work report/promotion PPT presentation for my presidential performance review. The presentation should include: my successful navigation of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression through the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that reduced unemployment from 10.0% to 4.7% and created 11.3 million jobs, my implementation of the Affordable Care Act that expanded healthcare coverage to over 20 million Americans, my restoration of America's international credibility through strategic diplomatic engagement including the Iran Nuclear Agreement and successful elimination of Osama bin Laden, and my post-presidency strategic focus on institutional capacity building through the Obama Foundation, designed to showcase my executive leadership capabilities and transformational achievements to support my legacy and future leadership initiatives.
