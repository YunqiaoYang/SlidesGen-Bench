Generate a PowerPoint presentation aimed to promote and launch our SAM 3 and SAM 3D products. The presentation should highlight the key features, such as text-prompted object segmentation in video and 3D reconstruction from a single image, and their benefits for creative media tools, AR/VR, and practical applications like Facebook Marketplace. It should include sections such as product overview, technical capabilities, use cases, demonstration of the Segment Anything Playground, and a call to action for creators and developers. The presentation should be engaging, visually appealing with examples of segmentation, and designed to showcase the competitive advantages of these AI models for understanding the visual world.
