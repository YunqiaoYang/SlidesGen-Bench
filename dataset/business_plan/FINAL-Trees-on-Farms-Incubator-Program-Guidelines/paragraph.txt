Generate a compelling PowerPoint presentation for the Trees on Farms Incubator Program focused on government stakeholder presentation. The presentation should include: program overview and objectives, eligibility criteria and application process, funding structure and grant details ($1 million total with up to $50,000 per project), assessment criteria and selection process, expected outcomes including landowner capacity building and project plan development, timeline and milestones, and success metrics for supporting Victorian rural landowners in tree establishment. Maintain a professional, policy-focused tone that emphasizes the program's environmental benefits, agricultural sustainability impact, and effective use of public funding to achieve climate action and rural development goals.
