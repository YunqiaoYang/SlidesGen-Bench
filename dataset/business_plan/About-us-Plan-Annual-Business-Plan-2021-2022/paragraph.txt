The presentation should include: the organization's strategic focus areas (Investment & Innovation, Behaviour Change & Education, Community Action), circular economy initiatives, climate change targets and emissions reduction goals, key programs like ResourceSmart Schools and Recycling Victoria policy implementation, financial projections and budget allocations, governance structure and organizational capabilities, and performance metrics aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals. Maintain a professional, data-driven tone that emphasizes environmental impact, community engagement, and Victoria's transition to a circular, climate-resilient economy while demonstrating accountability to government stakeholders and the Victorian community.
