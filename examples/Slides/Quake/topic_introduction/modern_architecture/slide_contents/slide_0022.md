## 3. Visual Interpretation

- **Image Description**: A low-angle photograph of a modern architectural structure featuring a central escalator flanked by two symmetrical concrete ramps leading upward toward a circular opening at the top. The circular opening contains yellow-tinted windows or panels, contrasting with the otherwise monochrome gray tones of the structure.
- **Visual Significance**: The image conveys a sense of upward progression and convergence toward a centralized, possibly symbolic, destination. The geometric precision and minimalist design reflect modernist architectural principles. The use of symmetry and verticality may suggest order, aspiration, or global connectivity—aligning thematically with the slide’s topic of "Global Interpretations of Modernism." The yellow elements introduce a focal point, potentially symbolizing enlightenment, innovation, or regional variation within a uniform framework.
