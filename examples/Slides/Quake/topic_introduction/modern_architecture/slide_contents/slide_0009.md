## 3. Visual Interpretation

- **Numbered Labels (1–5):**  
  Each box is labeled with a number (1 through 5) in a colored, brush-stroke style tag beneath it. The colors are:  
  - 1: Yellow  
  - 2: Black  
  - 3: Brown  
  - 4: Gray  
  - 5: Yellow  
  These numbers likely indicate a sequence or categorization of the five aesthetic aspects but do not convey quantitative data.

- **Box Borders:**  
  - Boxes 1 and 5 have yellow borders, suggesting emphasis or framing of the first and last points.  
  - Box 2 has a black border, Box 3 has a brown border, and Box 4 has a gray border—possibly indicating visual hierarchy or thematic grouping.

- **Icons/Images:**  
  - No images, icons, or illustrations are present that convey specific data or sentiment. All content is textual.
