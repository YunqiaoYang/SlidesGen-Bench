- **Numbered Boxes (1–7):**

  - Numbers 2, 4, and 6 are displayed in dark gray/black squares on the right side, associated with topics under "A Unique Eastern Perspective."  
  - The numbering suggests a sequence or thematic progression, but no explicit order is stated.  
  - The color variation (orange vs. dark gray) may imply categorization or emphasis, but no semantic meaning is conveyed beyond visual distinction.

- **Vertical Connector Line:**  
  - A yellow vertical line with square nodes connects the two columns, suggesting a relationship or flow between the two thematic sections ("Modernism in Asia" and "A Unique Eastern Perspective").  
  - The line implies a structured comparison or integration of ideas across regions and themes.

- **Layout Structure:**  
  - The slide uses a dual-column layout to contrast or juxtapose two perspectives on modernism in Asia.  
  - The left column focuses on specific regional or thematic aspects (Japan, urbanization, culture, environment), while the right emphasizes broader adaptations, projects, and technology.  
  - This structure visually conveys a comparative or complementary framework for understanding modernism in Asia.
