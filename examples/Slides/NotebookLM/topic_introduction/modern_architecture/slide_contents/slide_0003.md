# Content Quality & Accuracy Audit: Slide Extraction

## 1. Textual Claims (Verbatim)

### Headlines:
- **Title:** The New Trinity: Steel, Glass, and Concrete  
- **Subtitle:** The movement was enabled by a revolution in building materials and engineering. These new technologies offered architects unprecedented freedom to create stronger, lighter, and taller structures with new forms.

### Core Statements:
- Plate Glass: The cast plate glass process (1848) allowed for the manufacture of massive windows, leading to transparent “curtain walls.”
- Steel Frame: Steel framing led to the first skyscrapers, such as William Le Baron Jenney’s ten-story Home Insurance Building in Chicago (1884).
- Reinforced Concrete: Pioneered by François Coignet in 1853, concrete strengthened with iron bars could be molded into any shape and create vast interior spaces without supporting pillars.

### Callouts:
- None present.

## 3. Visual Interpretation

- **Left Image (Plate Glass):** Interior view of a large industrial or commercial hall with a glass arched roof supported by steel beams. The image illustrates the use of massive glass panels and steel framework, conveying transparency and structural innovation. Sentiment: Positive, highlighting technological advancement and openness.
- **Center Image (Steel Frame):** Exterior photograph of a tall, rectangular building with a grid-like façade, identified as the Home Insurance Building in Chicago. The image emphasizes verticality and urban density, symbolizing the emergence of skyscrapers. Sentiment: Historical significance and architectural progress.
- **Right Image (Reinforced Concrete):** Exterior view of a multi-story building with exposed concrete frame and open floor plan, showing columns and beams without internal supports. The image demonstrates structural flexibility and spatial freedom. Sentiment: Innovation in material application and design versatility.
