## 3. Visual Interpretation

- **Left Image (Black-and-white photograph):**  
  Depicts the controlled demolition of a large-scale modernist high-rise building amidst a cityscape. Thick clouds of dust and debris are visible, indicating destruction. The image conveys a sense of finality and rejection of modernist architecture, symbolizing the "end of an era." The surrounding buildings appear similar in style, suggesting a broader context of urban renewal or redevelopment.

- **Right Image (Color photograph):**  
  Shows a building with classical architectural elements—pediment, columns, decorative moldings, and symmetrical façade—indicative of Postmodern design. The clear blue sky and pristine condition contrast with the left image, symbolizing a new beginning and a return to ornamentation and historical reference. The visual juxtaposition emphasizes the transition from Modernism to Postmodernism.

- **Visual Contrast:**  
  The side-by-side images create a narrative arc: destruction of modernist ideals (left) and emergence of Postmodernist values (right). The imagery supports the textual claim about architectural evolution.
