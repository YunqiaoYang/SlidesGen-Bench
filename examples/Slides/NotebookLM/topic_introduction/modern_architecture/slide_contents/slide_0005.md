### Core Statements:
- The Bauhaus (1919–1933): Founded by Walter Gropius, this German school fused fine arts with crafts and industry. It promoted standardization, rational design for mass construction, and the idea of a “total work of art” (Gesamtkunstwerk). Its faculty included modern masters like Vasily Kandinsky and Paul Klee.
- CIAM (Congrès Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne): Founded in 1928, this series of conferences brought together Europe’s leading modernists—including Le Corbusier, Gropius, and Mies van der Rohe—to establish the basis for a common style and address the challenges of the modern city. Its “Athens Charter” became a highly influential text for post-war urban planning.
