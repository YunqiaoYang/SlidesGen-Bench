## 3. Visual Interpretation

- **World Map**: A grayscale world map with three red circular markers indicating locations in Latin America (Brazil), India, and Japan. Each marker is connected via lines to corresponding architectural images, visually linking regional adaptations of Modernism.
- **Image 1 (Brazil)**: A photograph of a white, sculptural building with curved forms and tall vertical elements, likely representing Oscar Niemeyer’s work in Brasília. Conveys a sense of fluidity and tropical adaptation through form.
- **Image 2 (Japan)**: An interior view of a large, vaulted structure with a symmetrical, ribbed ceiling and central column, possibly the National Stadium or similar work by Kenzo Tange. Suggests integration of modern engineering with spatial harmony.
- **Image 3 (India)**: A photograph of a brutalist-style concrete building with cantilevered roofs and grid-like façade, characteristic of Le Corbusier’s Chandigarh architecture. Communicates monumentality and functional modernism.
- **Icons/Arrows**: No icons or arrows convey data; only connecting lines from map to images for spatial reference.
