- Early towers, nicknamed ‘Cathedrals of Commerce,’ were modern in structure but clad in historical ornament.
- Post-war modernists stripped this away.
- Mies van der Rohe's work set a new standard for purity, while engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan revolutionized skyscraper construction with his ‘trussed-tube’ (John Hancock Center) and ‘bundled-tube’ (Willis Tower) systems, allowing buildings to become even taller and more sculptural.

## 3. Visual Interpretation

- **Image 1 (Left):** Black-and-white photograph of the Woolworth Building, labeled "Woolworth Building, Cass Gilbert (1912)". The image shows ornate Gothic Revival architectural details, conveying historical ornamentation and verticality. The visual emphasizes decorative complexity, aligning with the text’s description of early skyscrapers as “clad in historical ornament.”
- **Image 2 (Right):** Color photograph of the Seagram Building, labeled "Seagram Building, Mies van der Rohe (1958)". The image displays a minimalist, grid-like façade with large glass windows and a clean, rectilinear form. The lighting highlights the building’s transparency and structural clarity, visually reinforcing the text’s claim about modernist purity and simplicity.
- **Visual Contrast:** The juxtaposition of the two images illustrates the architectural evolution from ornate historical styles to modernist minimalism, supporting the narrative of stylistic transformation in skyscraper design.
