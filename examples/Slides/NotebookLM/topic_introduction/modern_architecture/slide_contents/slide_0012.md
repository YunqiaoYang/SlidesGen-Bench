- **Left image (interior dome):** A spiraling, multi-tiered interior space with a radial skylight at the center. The curved forms and layered geometry suggest fluidity and organic movement, conveying a sense of upward expansion and lightness. This visual emphasizes sculptural form and spatial expression.
- **Top-right image (exterior structure):** A concrete building with thick columns and an overhanging roof, featuring irregularly placed small windows. The design suggests structural boldness and monumental scale, emphasizing raw materiality and expressive massing.
- **Bottom-right image (airport terminal):** A low-slung, white, wing-like structure with a sweeping curved roof and large glass facade. An airplane is visible in front, indicating functional use as an airport terminal. The form evokes dynamism and motion, symbolizing flight and modernity. The clean lines and dramatic silhouette highlight expressive architecture.
