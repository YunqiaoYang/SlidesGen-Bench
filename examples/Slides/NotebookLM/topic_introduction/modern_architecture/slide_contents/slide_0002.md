### Left Image:
- A black-and-white photograph of the Palais Garnier (Paris Opera House), showcasing ornate classical architectural features including columns, sculpted reliefs, decorative moldings, and statues.
- The image conveys a sense of historical grandeur and ornamentation, symbolizing the architectural styles being rejected by Modernism.

- The image emphasizes simplicity, functionality, and absence of decoration, visually representing the principles of Modernist architecture.

### Visual Contrast:
- The juxtaposition of the two images illustrates a direct contrast between ornate historical architecture and minimalist modern design.
- The visual narrative supports the textual claim of a "forceful rejection of ornament" through side-by-side comparison.
